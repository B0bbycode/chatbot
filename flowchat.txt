	4: how long does my subscription last using the basic plan?

note: if client input any of the functions above, a link to an article containing the above questions should be displayed.
and  if client input something else. the chatbot should suggest the below methods

chatbot: it seems you have a different input, would you like me to transfer you to the customer care online?
	enter "y" for yes and "n" for no.

if user enters "y" the chatbot dialogue should display "connecting to support"
if user enters "n" the chatbot dialogue should display "would you like to start over ?" enter "y" for yes and "n" for end chat.
if otherwise the user enters a wrong input the chatbot should display the previous question
